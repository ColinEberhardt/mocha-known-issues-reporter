#Mocha-Known-Issues-Reporter

A custom reporter for mocha that reports against a set of known issues. As a result it is able to indicate whether a particular pass or fail is due to a known issue, new issue, or whether it indicates a resolved issue. This reporter is useful for projects that may have a number of un-resolved 'known' issues that exist for a significant amount of time.
